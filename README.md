## About this guide

Ecoacoustics — the study of soundscapes to understand ecological processes — depends on well-designed recording and analysis methods.  

This repository provides evidence-based guidance for ecoacoustic monitoring, combining practical recommendations with scientifically supported best practices for recorder deployment, metadata management, and data analysis. While useful guidance already exists for scientists and conservation practitioners (examples below), much of it is presented as static documents that may not keep pace with the rapid development of the field:  

- [WWF Acoustic Monitoring Guidance](https://www.wwf.org.uk/project/conservationtechnology/acoustic-monitoring)  
- [Guidelines for Long-Term Ecoacoustic Monitoring](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/applied-ecology-resources/document/20230136742/)  
- [UK Bird Survey Guidelines: Acoustic Survey Methods](https://birdsurveyguidelines.org/acoustic-survey-methods)  

This GitHub project aims to fill that gap by serving as a living, community-driven resource. It provides consistent, transparent, and reproducible methods informed by both scientific evidence and practitioner experience. The approach is inspired by [Conservation Evidence](https://www.conservationevidence.com), which synthesizes research on conservation actions — such as habitat or species management — into accessible, evidence-based summaries.


## Repository contents

This repository is organized into three main sections:

1. 🎙️ [**Recorder Deployment**](./recorder-deployment.md)  
   Evidence-based recommendations for programming and field deployment of automated acoustic recorders. Includes guidance on audio settings, recording schedules, and spatial sampling design.

2. 🗂️ [**Metadata**](./metadata.md)  
   Recommendations for recording essential contextual information alongside ecoacoustic data, following FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles.

3. 📊 [**Data Analysis**](./data-analysis.md)  
   Overview of approaches for processing and analyzing ecoacoustic recordings, including acoustic indices, species detection, and statistical considerations.

## Background

The recommendations presented here were developed through a synthesis of peer-reviewed evidence, field experience, and expert input.  
A key component of this work was a questionnaire distributed at the UK Acoustics Network (UKAN+) Ecoacoustics Symposium (Manchester Metropolitan University, June 15–16, 2022), which gathered input from 84 ecoacoustic practitioners. The responses informed the development of best-practice recommendations for ecoacoustic study design, recorder settings, and deployment strategies.

## Quick start

If you are planning an ecoacoustic monitoring project:

1. **Define your objectives** – species detection, soundscape monitoring, or long-term ecological assessment.  
2. **Consult the [Recorder Deployment](./recorder-deployment.md)** guide for device selection, audio settings, and deployment strategies.  
3. **Record contextual data** using the **[Metadata](./metadata.md)** guidelines.  
4. **Process and analyze** your data following the **[Data Analysis](./data-analysis.md)** recommendations.  
5. **Document and share** your methods and findings to support reproducibility.

## Contribute

This repository is designed to evolve with the ecoacoustics community.  
We warmly invite **contributions, comments, and new evidence** that can strengthen or refine the recommendations.

Ways to [contribute](./contribute.md):
- 💬 **Open an Issue** to share feedback, point out uncertainties, or suggest revisions.  
- 🧩 **Submit a Pull Request** to add new evidence or clarify existing guidance.  
- 📄 **Email your input** (e.g. relevant literature, summaries, or datasets) to *[carlos.abrahams@ntu.ac.uk]*.  

We are especially keen to receive:
- Summaries or excerpts (“evidence snippets”) from published or ongoing ecoacoustic research.  
- Comments on the validity and applicability of the recommendations.  
- Suggestions for additional sections or case studies.

All contributions—large or small—are appreciated and will be acknowledged where appropriate.  

Together we can build a stronger, evidence-based foundation for ecoacoustic monitoring.
