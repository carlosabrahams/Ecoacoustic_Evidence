## Repository contents

This repository is organized into three main sections:

1. 🎙️ [**Recorder Deployment**](./recorder-deployment.md)  
   Evidence-based recommendations for programming and field deployment of automated acoustic recorders. Includes guidance on audio settings, recording schedules, and spatial sampling design.

2. 🗂️ [**Metadata**](./metadata.md)  
   Recommendations for recording essential contextual information alongside ecoacoustic data, following FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles.

3. 📊 [**Data Analysis**](./data-analysis.md)  
   Overview of approaches for processing and analyzing ecoacoustic recordings, including acoustic indices, species detection, and statistical considerations.

## Background

The recommendations presented here were developed through a synthesis of peer-reviewed evidence, field experience, and expert input.  
A key component of this work was a **questionnaire distributed at the UK Acoustics Network (UKAN+) Ecoacoustics Symposium** (Manchester Metropolitan University, June 15–16, 2022), which gathered input from 84 ecoacoustic practitioners. The responses informed the development of best-practice recommendations for ecoacoustic study design, recorder settings, and deployment strategies.

## Quick start

If you are planning an ecoacoustic monitoring project:

1. **Define your objectives** – species detection, soundscape monitoring, or long-term ecological assessment.  
2. **Consult the [Recorder Deployment](./recorder-deployment.md)** guide for device selection, audio settings, and deployment strategies.  
3. **Record contextual data** using the **[Metadata](./metadata.md)** guidelines.  
4. **Process and analyze** your data following the **[Data Analysis](./data-analysis.md)** recommendations.  
5. **Document and share** your methods and findings to support reproducibility.

## Contribute

This repository is designed to evolve with the ecoacoustics community.  
We warmly invite **contributions, comments, and new evidence** that can strengthen or refine the recommendations.

Ways to contribute:
- 💬 **Open an Issue** to share feedback, point out uncertainties, or suggest revisions.  
- 🧩 **Submit a Pull Request** to add new evidence or clarify existing guidance.  
- 📄 **Email your input** (e.g. relevant literature, summaries, or datasets) to *[your.email@institution.edu]*.  

We are especially keen to receive:
- Summaries or excerpts (“evidence snippets”) from published or ongoing ecoacoustic research.  
- Comments on the validity and applicability of the recommendations.  
- Suggestions for additional sections or case studies.

All contributions—large or small—are appreciated and will be acknowledged where appropriate.  

Together we can build a stronger, evidence-based foundation for ecoacoustic monitoring.
