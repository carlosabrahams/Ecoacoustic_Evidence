# Metadata

## Recommendations

At the start of each deployment, record the date/time, surveyor name, sampling location, recorder/microphone identifiers and settings. Photographs of location and set-up should be taken. Weather conditions during the survey period should also be recorded.

Many bioacoustic recorders embed metadata within the header of the .WAV sound files, and within each filename, potentially including parameters such as date, time, location coordinates, recorder identification code, and audio settings. This information should be retained alongside the audio data.

There is a current development project - [Safe and Sound](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bPODHowsJtEkI8z8GQJKoywU9EWALt_d2ldMNvqA0hM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.7z7cgy7v2giy) - to develop a common standard for ecoacoustic metadata. The goal of the project is to improve data exchange and support large-scale studies by promoting the adoption of a standardized metadata schema, primarily based on the existing Camtrap DP (Camera Trap Data Package) standard. This webinar, from 5 June 2025, provides more information: [Wildlabs Safe & Sound](https://wildlabs.net/event/standard-bioacoustic-data-safe-and-sound)

## Rationale

With each survey deployment, appropriate metadata including location, dates/times, habitat and equipment identifiers should be recorded. This can be done using paper/tablet, or by speaking into the microphone while the unit is recording, so the metadata becomes part of the recorded data itself. 

This background data is clearly needed to accurately organise and archive recordings, and can be used for any detailed analysis of how environmental characteristics determine the bird acoustic assemblage. It is also important to make acoustic data as comparable as possible across different surveys, allowing use in larger-scale monitoring projects and contributions to databases.

## Research evidence

Oswald et al. (2022) recognise that the types of metadata required for a project may vary with the aims and scope of each study, but that it will commonly include information such as the time of the recordings, location, equipment and settings used, and weather conditions.

Cherrill (2020) sets out general principles for metadata management in reporting, sharing and archiving of ecological data. It does not specifically cover acoustic recordings, but includes many relevant recommendations for ecological metadata.

Roch et al (2016) shows how the effective collection, storage and analysis of acoustic data is dependent on consistent, organised and transparent metadata, which should include, at the minimum, details on the equipment deployment and environmental conditions.
