# Contribute

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving this guide! There are several ways you can help:

## Provide New Evidence Snippets

Please summarise and report key features of new research by providing the author citation, a short (2-3 sentence) note, and the DOI hyperlink for the research.  Here is an example:

> Symes et al (2022) performed a simulation to test trade-offs between recording at more sites, or for longer durations, when total sampling time was the same. Adding locations resulted in more species per unit of analysis effort than adding more days, e.g. species detection saturated at 30 species when sampling in one location and at 41 species when the same sampling duration was spread was across ten sites.
